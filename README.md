Video Rental System(VRS) helps people in renting/buying the movies they like to watch. The
system is an online video renting portal, which will be helpful not only for the customers to buy
or rent movies but also staff to maintain the inventory. Basically, the customer will sign up and
they can surf through various genres to find the movie they like to rent. Information about
various movies, their genres, Cast and crew and similar movies will also be displayed. The
customers can add the required movies to the cart, order and pay for the movies. The staff on
the other hand makes sure the movies on demand are being stocked up frequently and
customers do not cross the deadlines to return the movies back.
